 Doctran is designed to make chaining document transformations easy. For
 example, you may want to first redact all PII from a document before sending it
 over to OpenAI to be summarized. Ordering is important when chaining
 transformations - transformations that are invoked first will be executed
 first, and its result will be passed to the next transformation. ```python

 Vector databases are useful for retrieving context for LLMs, however they
 struggle to find relevant information if the source documents are indexed
 hapharzardly and information is sparse. Doctran uses LLMs and open source NLP
 libraries to transform raw text into clean, structured, information-dense
-documents that are optimized for vector space retrieval. Doctran is maintained

 Doctran is designed to make chaining document transformations easy. For
 example, you may want to first redact all PII from a document before sending it
 over to OpenAI to be summarized. Ordering is important when chaining
 transformations - transformations that are invoked first will be executed
 first, and its result will be passed to the next transformation. ```python
 document = await document.redact(entities=["EMAIL_ADDRESS",
 "PHONE_NUMBER"]).extract(properties).summarize().execute() ``` ##

 calling to extract structured data from a document. ```python from doctran

 names, emails, phone numbers and other sensitive information from a document.
